					The Academy provides a full range of instruction in painting using oils, coloured pencil, charcoal and white chalk and graphite.
					<br> <br>
					The instructor will first provide some instruction, usually lasting about a half hour.  The student will then be allowed to practise what has been demonstrated.  During the remainder of the class, the instructor will periodically review the students work and provide suggestions for improvement.
					<br> <br>
					Instruction is provided through one of two primary programs:

					<h1 class="craft-pricing__heading">Private Lessons</h1>
					<article class="craft-pricing__desc">
						Under this option, students can design a self-directed program.  Students can propose a specific piece of art that they would like to try.  Or students can request instruction in particular areas that are new to them (new techniques or new materials) or where they feel that their technique may be weak.  Students can bring in a piece that they have already started but are unsure how to proceed further or that reveals a weakness they have identified and would like to know how to correct. We recommend contacting us ahead of time to see if we can facilitate your needs.
						Classes are three hours in length, may include more than one student, organized monthly and paid for a month in advance.
